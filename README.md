# Quadratic Equation Solver

This Python program solves quadratic equations and displays their roots. It accepts user input for the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) of a quadratic equation in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) and determines the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex).

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting coefficients.
- Determines and displays the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex).
- Handles invalid input and special cases like when \( a = 0 \) (not a quadratic equation).

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) when prompted.
3. Confirm if the displayed equation is correct.
4. View the calculated roots of the quadratic equation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
